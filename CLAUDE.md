- **Teaching content**: Accessible, warm, student-focused
- **About/personal**: Authentic, inspiring, mission-driven

### 2. Dissertation is Central
The dissertation on **AI-powered cognitive scaffolding** is the primary focus. All content should support or connect to this work:

- Free learning platform = research instrument
- AI Journey = building technical capacity for dissertation
- Teaching at SMC = understanding target population
- Personal story = motivation and unique perspective

### 3. Preserve Design Integrity
- **Use `style.css`** for all pages (external stylesheet)
- **Consistent navigation** across all pages
- **Responsive design** - test on mobile
- **Color themes**:
  - Main site: Blue/terracotta professional palette
  - Mommy Camp: Pink accent preserved for personality
- **No inline styles** unless absolutely necessary (mommy-camp custom theme OK)

### 4. Content Guidelines

**Research Pages** (research.html, participate.html, publications.html):
- Professional, academic tone
- Rigorous, evidence-based language

- Research
- Math 54
- Math 4/4C
- AI Journey
- Publications

**Footer Navigation** (appears on all pages):
- Home
- About
- Research
- Publications
- Contact (email link)

**Active States**: Use `class="active"` on current page's nav link

### 7. SEO & Metadata
Every page should have:
- `<meta name="description">` with relevant description
- `<title>` tag with page name and "Safaa Dabagh"
- `<meta name="viewport">` for mobile responsiveness
- Descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Semantic HTML (proper heading hierarchy)
