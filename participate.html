      <h2>What is This Study About?</h2>
      <p>
        I'm conducting dissertation research on <strong>AI-powered cognitive scaffolding</strong> for statistics education. The goal is to understand how AI tutoring can help students learn statistics more effectively, and whether it works equally well for all students.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Your participation helps answer:</strong> Can AI provide personalized support that improves learning outcomes in statistics? What makes AI tutoring trustworthy and effective across diverse student populations?</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>Do I get paid or receive compensation?</h4>
        <p>
          You receive the free statistics course (equivalent value to a $100-300 textbook and online course). There is no monetary compensation, but you gain valuable statistics knowledge at no cost.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>What if I'm already taking a statistics class?</h4>
        <p>
          That's fine! Many participants use this as supplemental learning. However, please check with your instructor about academic integrity policies if you plan to use the AI tutor for homework help.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>Will I definitely get access to the AI tutor?</h4>
        <p>
          This is a randomized study, so some participants will have AI tutor access and others will have access to curated resources without AI. Both groups get the full course content—the difference is the type of support available when you're stuck.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>How do you protect my privacy?</h4>
        <p>
          You'll be assigned a random anonymous ID. Your email is only used for platform login and sending course updates—it's not connected to your research data. All analysis uses anonymous IDs, and published results report only aggregate findings.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>Can I see the data you collect about me?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes! You can request a copy of your own data at any time. Email me at <a href="mailto:dabagh_safaa@smc.edu">dabagh_safaa@smc.edu</a> with your request.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>When does the study start?</h4>
        <p>
          The pilot study begins <strong>Winter 2026</strong>. The main study runs <strong>Spring-Fall 2026</strong>. You can enroll on a rolling basis—courses start every few weeks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>What happens to the research findings?</h4>
        <p>
          Results will be published in my dissertation and submitted to academic journals and education conferences. I'll also share findings on this website so participants can see what we learned. The platform will remain free and open for future students.
