  <h1>🌿 About Me</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, I'm <strong>Safaa Dabagh</strong> — a Lebanese-American mom of five, math instructor, and lifelong learner.
  </p>

  <p>
    I came to the U.S. with my three eldest children, determined to build a new life. I started at West Los Angeles College, then transferred to UCLA, where I earned a bachelor’s degree in Math/Economics and a minor in Statistics.
  </p>

  <p>
    After completing my undergraduate studies, I continued on to earn my master’s degree in Statistics from UCLA and began my PhD. My doctoral journey was interrupted when I lost my mother, but now more than ever, I am committed to completing my dissertation and research.
  </p>

  <p>
    Raising a large family while teaching and pursuing higher education has shaped my outlook on resilience, growth, and empathy. My children — Adam, Aya, Abed, Issa, and Zachariah — are my greatest inspiration and the heart of my journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    I see myself as a student of life: always evolving, always curious. Whether I’m guiding students, parenting, or researching how AI can transform education, I lead with purpose, kindness, and determination.
