  <h1>🌿 About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Safaa Dabagh</strong> — a Lebanese-American mom of five, math instructor, and lifelong learner.</p>

  <p>
    I came to the U.S. as a student and made my life here as both a scholar and a mother. Raising a large family while teaching and pursuing a PhD has shaped my perspective on resilience, education, and compassion. My children — Adam, Aya, Abed, Issa, and Zachariah — are my greatest inspiration and source of strength.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe in always evolving. I see myself as a student of life: constantly growing, sometimes stumbling, but always moving forward with purpose. This journey has made me passionate about building bridges between education and real life — especially through technology and AI.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether I'm supporting students in the classroom, parenting with my whole heart, or studying how AI can help learners thrive, I'm guided by the same values: empathy, perseverance, and curiosity.
