      <h2>My Journey</h2>

      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Safaa Dabagh</strong> — a Lebanese-American mother, educator, researcher, and lifelong learner.
      </p>

      <p>
        I came to the United States with my three eldest children, determined to build a new life and create opportunities for my family. Like many immigrants, I started at community college—West Los Angeles College—where dedicated teachers saw my potential and encouraged me to dream bigger.
      </p>

      <p>
        I transferred to <strong>UCLA</strong>, where I earned my bachelor's degree in Mathematics/Economics with a minor in Statistics. The experience transformed me. I discovered my passion for statistics and its power to uncover truth in data, tell stories, and inform decisions that affect real people's lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        After completing my undergraduate degree, I continued at UCLA to earn my <strong>master's degree in Statistics</strong> and began my PhD. But life had other plans—when I lost my mother, I had to pause my doctoral journey to care for my family and process the grief.
      </p>

      <h2>Coming Back Stronger</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Now, years later, I'm back and more determined than ever to complete my dissertation. My research focuses on <strong>AI-powered cognitive scaffolding for statistics education</strong>, with particular attention to students like those I teach every day at Santa Monica College—diverse learners who face barriers but have immense potential.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          This work is deeply personal. I know what it's like to be underestimated, to struggle, to juggle family and school, to wonder if you belong. My research isn't just academic—it's a mission to create tools that help students overcome obstacles and succeed.
        </p>
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2>My Family</h2>

      <p>
        My five children—<strong>Adam, Aya, Abed, Issa, and Zachariah</strong>—are my greatest inspiration and the heart of my journey. They've watched me study, struggle, grow, and persist. They've learned that education is a lifelong journey, that setbacks are temporary, and that it's never too late to pursue your dreams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Raising a large family while teaching full-time and pursuing a PhD is challenging, but it's also taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, time management, patience, and what truly matters. I even run a <a href="mommy-camp.html">home coding camp</a> for my youngest two during the summer!
      </p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>
          <strong>My children are why I do this work.</strong> I want them—and all students—to live in a world where quality education is accessible, where AI can help rather than replace human connection, and where every learner has the support they need to thrive.
        </p>

      <h2>Teaching at Santa Monica College</h2>

      <p>
        I've been teaching mathematics and statistics at <strong>Santa Monica College</strong> since 2020. This work grounds my research in reality. I see firsthand the challenges students face—financial stress, work obligations, family responsibilities, imposter syndrome, gaps in preparation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also see their incredible determination, creativity, and potential. My students inspire me every day. They're working parents, recent immigrants, first-generation college students, career changers, and dreamers. They deserve educational tools that meet them where they are and help them reach their goals.
      </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>What I Teach</h3>
        <ul class="icon-list">
          <li><strong>Math 54 (Introductory Statistics):</strong> Where I help students discover that statistics isn't just formulas—it's a way of thinking critically about the world</li>
          <li><strong>Math 4/4C (College Algebra):</strong> Where I build confidence and foundational skills for STEM success</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-2">
          I use technology thoughtfully, connect math to real-world contexts, and create a classroom culture where mistakes are learning opportunities and every question is valued.

      <h2>My Values</h2>

      <div class="course-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Educational Equity</h3>
          <p>Quality education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of income, background, or circumstances. Technology should reduce, not amplify, educational inequalities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Lifelong Learning</h3>
          <p>I'm a perpetual student. Whether it's statistics, AI, pedagogy, or parenting—I believe growth never stops. My <a href="ai-education.html">AI in Education journey</a> is one example.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Research for Good</h3>
          <p>Academic research should serve the public good. My dissertation creates both knowledge <em>and</em> a free platform that helps real students learn statistics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Compassion</h3>
          <p>Behind every data point is a human being. I lead with empathy, whether teaching students, designing AI systems, or raising children.</p>
        </div>

      <h2>Beyond Academics</h2>

      <p>
        When I'm not teaching, researching, or parenting, I'm probably:
      </p>

      <ul class="icon-list">
        <li>Reading about educational technology and learning sciences</li>
        <li>Experimenting with AI tools and thinking about their pedagogical applications</li>
        <li>Planning activities for <a href="mommy-camp.html">Mommy Coding Camp</a></li>
        <li>Cooking for my family (feeding seven people is its own optimization problem!)</li>
        <li>Connecting with other community college educators and researchers</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Drives Me</h2>

      <div class="research-box">
        <p>
          I see myself as a <strong>bridge-builder</strong>:
        </p>

        <ul class="icon-list mt-2">
          <li><strong>Between research and practice:</strong> Using scholarly work to improve real classrooms</li>
          <li><strong>Between technology and humanity:</strong> Leveraging AI while centering human needs</li>
          <li><strong>Between institutions:</strong> Studying how context shapes learning across community colleges, universities, and beyond</li>
          <li><strong>Between theory and reality:</strong> Translating learning sciences into tools that actually work for diverse students</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-2">
          My unique perspective—as an immigrant, mother, community college student-turned-professor, and PhD researcher—allows me to see problems and solutions others might miss.

      <h2>Let's Connect</h2>

      <p>
        I love connecting with fellow educators, researchers, students, and anyone passionate about improving education through technology.
