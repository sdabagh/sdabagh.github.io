  <h1>Welcome!</h1>

  <p>
    I'm <strong>Safaa Dabagh</strong>, a community college mathematics and statistics instructor — and a PhD student in Statistics working to complete my dissertation. I'm passionate about educational equity and innovation, with a special interest in how artificial intelligence can support student learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current focus is on integrating AI-driven tutoring tools into platforms like Canvas to support student success in math courses, especially at the community college level.

  <h2>🧑‍🏫 Teaching Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    I believe that every student can succeed in mathematics with the right support and tools. My teaching philosophy is rooted in compassion, clarity, and empowerment. I strive to create an inclusive and encouraging environment where students feel safe to ask questions, make mistakes, and grow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether in person or online, I aim to connect concepts to real-life contexts and use technology to support diverse learning styles. I am especially passionate about increasing access to statistics and data literacy for all learners.
