## STUDY OVERVIEW

### What is this study about?

This research study explores how artificial intelligence (AI) tutoring can help students learn statistics. We are testing an online learning platform that provides personalized support at different levels - sometimes giving hints, sometimes asking questions, and sometimes providing step-by-step explanations. This approach is called "cognitive scaffolding" because it adapts to what you need, just like a good teacher would.

By participating, you'll get free access to a complete introductory statistics course while helping us understand how AI can make education more effective and accessible.

### Why are we doing this research?

Statistics is an important subject for many careers, but many students find it challenging. We want to know if AI-powered tutoring can help students understand statistics better, feel more confident, and succeed in their learning. Your participation will help us improve educational technology for future students.

### Who is conducting this study?

This study is being conducted by Safaa Dabagh, a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at UCLA, under the supervision of faculty advisors Prof. Mark Handcock (Social Statistics) and Prof. Guang Cheng (Trustworthy AI). This research is part of a doctoral dissertation at UCLA.
