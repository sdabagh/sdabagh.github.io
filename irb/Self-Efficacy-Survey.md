# STATISTICS SELF-EFFICACY SURVEY

---

## Introduction

This survey measures your **confidence in your ability to perform statistics-related tasks**.

**Self-efficacy** refers to your belief in your own ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish tasks. Research shows that self-efficacy is strongly related to learning outcomes and persistence in challenging subjects like statistics.

**Purpose**: We will ask you to complete this survey **before you start the course** and **again after you complete it** to measure changes in your confidence. This helps us understand if the AI-powered learning platform improves students' belief in their statistics abilities.

**Instructions**: Please be honest about your current confidence level. There are **no right or wrong answers**. We want to know how you feel right now, not how you think you "should" feel.

**Estimated time**: 5 minutes

## RATING SCALE

For each statement below, please indicate how confident you are in your ability to perform the task **right now**.

Use the following scale:

**1** = Not at all confident (I definitely cannot do this)
**2** = Slightly confident (I probably cannot do this)
**3** = Moderately confident (I might be able to do this)
**4** = Very confident (I probably can do this)
**5** = Extremely confident (I definitely can do this)

## SCORING INFORMATION (For Research Team Only)

### Subscales:

**Basic Concepts** (Items 1-5): Mean score = Sum / 5
**Data Visualization** (Items 6-9): Mean score = Sum / 4
**Probability & Distributions** (Items 10-13): Mean score = Sum / 4
**Inferential Statistics** (Items 14-18): Mean score = Sum / 5
**Regression & Correlation** (Items 19-22): Mean score = Sum / 4
**Applied Skills** (Items 23-28): Mean score = Sum / 6
**Anxiety & Attitudes** (Items 29-32): See note below

**Overall Self-Efficacy Score**: Mean of items 1-28 (exclude items 29-32)

**Note on Items 29-32**: These measure anxiety and general academic self-efficacy. Item 29 should be reverse-scored (6 minus the rating) before averaging with items 30-32.

### Interpretation:

- **1.0 - 2.0**: Low self-efficacy (student lacks confidence)
- **2.1 - 3.0**: Below average self-efficacy
- **3.1 - 4.0**: Moderate self-efficacy
- **4.1 - 5.0**: High self-efficacy (student is confident)

### Expected Changes:

Pre-to-post differences of **0.5 or greater** on the overall scale or subscales indicate meaningful improvements in self-efficacy.

## THANK YOU!

Thank you for completing this self-efficacy survey!

Your responses help us understand how the learning platform affects students' confidence in their statistics abilities.

**When will I take this again?**

You will be invited to complete this same survey **after you finish the course** (or after 16 weeks, whichever comes first). Comparing your responses will show how much your confidence has changed.

**Questions?**
