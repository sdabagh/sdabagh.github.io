      <h2>Research Overview</h2>
      <p>
        My dissertation investigates how <strong>AI-powered cognitive scaffolding systems</strong> can improve learning outcomes in introductory statistics, with particular attention to <strong>diverse student populations across different institutional contexts</strong>.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Core Question:</strong> Can AI provide adaptive, personalized support that helps students overcome common conceptual obstacles in statistics while maintaining trustworthiness, fairness, and educational effectiveness?</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <ul class="icon-list">
        <li><strong>High failure rates in statistics:</strong> Especially at community colleges, where students often face additional barriers to success</li>
        <li><strong>One-size-fits-all doesn't work:</strong> Students come with diverse backgrounds, preparation levels, and learning needs</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability challenge:</strong> Instructors can't provide individualized support to every student at the moment of need</li>
        <li><strong>AI's untapped potential:</strong> Modern AI can provide adaptive scaffolding, but we need rigorous research to understand effectiveness and equity implications</li>
        <li><strong>Trustworthiness questions:</strong> How do we ensure AI tutoring is accurate, fair, explainable, and beneficial across all student populations?</li>
      </ul>

        <div class="card-header">
          <h3 class="card-title">Primary Research Questions</h3>
        </div>

        <h4>RQ1: Effectiveness</h4>
        <p>How does AI-powered cognitive scaffolding affect learning outcomes in introductory statistics compared to traditional online resources?</p>

        <h4>RQ2: Scaffolding Strategies</h4>
        <p>What types of cognitive scaffolding (minimal hints, moderate guidance, extensive support) are most effective for different statistical concepts and student populations?</p>

        <h4>RQ3: Institutional & Demographic Differences</h4>
        <p>How do diverse student populations across different institutional contexts (community college, research university, open enrollment) engage with and benefit from AI scaffolding?</p>

        <h4>RQ4: Trustworthy AI</h4>
        <p>What design features ensure AI tutoring systems are trustworthy, fair, accurate, and explainable across all student demographic groups?</p>

      <h2>The Platform as Research Instrument</h2>

      <p>
        I am building a <strong>free online statistics learning platform</strong> that serves dual purposes:
      </p>

      <div class="course-grid">
        <div class="course-card">
          <h3 class="course-title">Educational Mission</h3>
          <p>Provide high-quality, accessible statistics education to anyone who wants to learn, regardless of financial means or institutional affiliation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="course-card">
          <h3 class="course-title">Research Instrument</h3>
          <p>Collect rigorous data on how AI-powered cognitive scaffolding affects learning, engagement, and equity in statistics education.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <p><strong>Ethical Research:</strong> All research participation is voluntary with informed consent. Students can use the platform whether or not they participate in research. Data is anonymized and protected according to UCLA IRB protocols.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

      <h2>What Makes This Novel</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Cognitive Scaffolding, Not Just Q&A</h3>
        <p>Unlike typical AI chatbots that simply answer questions, this system provides <strong>adaptive scaffolding</strong>—progressive hints, Socratic questioning, and just-in-time support that fades as students gain mastery.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Multi-Institutional Comparison</h3>
        <p>By studying students across different contexts (community college, research university, open enrollment), I can understand how institutional factors and student demographics affect AI scaffolding effectiveness.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Trustworthy AI Framework</h3>
        <p>Working with Professor Guang Cheng's expertise in trustworthy AI, the platform includes monitoring for accuracy, fairness across demographic groups, explainability, and reliability.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Real-World Impact</h3>
        <p>This isn't just a lab study—real students learn real statistics while contributing to research that will improve education for future learners.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Theoretical Framework</h2>

      <p>This research draws on multiple theoretical traditions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Load Theory:</strong> How scaffolding reduces extraneous cognitive load</li>
        <li><strong>Zone of Proximal Development:</strong> AI provides support at the edge of student capability</li>
        <li><strong>Metacognition:</strong> Scaffolding promotes self-regulated learning</li>
        <li><strong>Equity & Access:</strong> How technology can reduce or amplify educational inequalities</li>
        <li><strong>Trustworthy AI:</strong> Ensuring fairness, transparency, and reliability</li>
      </ul>
